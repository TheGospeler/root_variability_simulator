"""The root_variability_simulator is a novel software package that simulates root distribution.

This software simulates root spatial distribution at the subsurface using data obtained
via geophysical exploration method. Electrical Resistivity Method is one of the widely
used geophysical method. It specializes in probing the images at the subsurface using
resistivity contrast below the ground. Electrical Resistivity method is best suited for
shallow depth investigation, i.e. between few meters to few hundreds of meters.

The root_variability_simulator produces tomography of the true resistivity values.

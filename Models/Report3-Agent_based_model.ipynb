    "Applying it directly to my research will not be feasible at this initial stage of my research. But agent based modeling will come very handy in terms of representation of my results. Knowing the factors responsible for root spatial variability is the initial stage of this project.\n",

    "Agent-based modeling will come very handy in simulating root spatial variabity after the dependencies are established. Once this dependencies are identified, then agent-based model will be initiated to simulate root spatial variability in different scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Particularly, I like this visualization of events and interaction of the agents and the environment. Consequently, I can visualize the root spatial variation given the initial constraints responsible for the root growth and variation. I hope to make this work as this will yield to a spectacular result and a huge milestone for my research.\n",

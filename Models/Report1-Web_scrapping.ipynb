    "##### Possible Questions\n",
    "The climate plays an important factor in plants relating to plant growth. Such parameters mainly include, Sunlight, rainfall, and other soil moisture attributes; providing the necessary energy needed and water for the growth of plants. Hence, by accessing these weather parameters on different time scale and on a daily basis can help in predicting the plant growth, which also could be an indication to the spatial variability of roots of the same plants which is my topic of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, plausible questions are:\n",
    "* What are the relationship between climate and Plant growth and/or roots?\n",
    "* Can we predict Weather parameter on short term and long term scale?\n",
    "* What management practices can we employ knowing future trend of the important climatic data?\n",
    "* For my research, after establishing a relationship between the roots of the plant/trees and the water depth via the analysis of the Electrical Resistivity Tomography, can we juxtapose the weather parameter and see any important relationship between the roots variability and the weather data or the water depth?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data Source\n",
    "The most appropriate source to get the data from will be from GeoData, NOAA, NASA, and from the field weather station where the resistivity values are obtained from.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Developing Software\n",
    "* Automated Web scrapping software\n",
    "* In time past, people have used regression model (Stephen, 1982), and recently machine learning models (Christias and Mocanu, 2021)\n",
    "* I would have to create a software that can first visualize the tomography of the resistivity estimated or obtained, analyze the results and get the weather parameter in the location, where I can then used Machine Learning models to construct relationship and predictions."

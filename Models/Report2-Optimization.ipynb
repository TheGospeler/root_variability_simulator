    "* Using Sympy and LaTex in printing properly formated mathematical Equation.\n",
    "* Introductory application of optimization approaches such as Brute Force Methods (used for smaller problems), Iterative method (Graident Descent), and Random methods (Monte Carlo).\n",

    "* Application of Optimization such as in curve fitting, obtaining the optimal parameters\n",
    "* Creating an environment in conda, activating, install packages in the created environment, and deactivating packages. A usefulness of this is to temporally use external modules for testing.\n",

    "In conclusion, I have learnt that optimization can help us in determining the best approach to a scenerio giving the major contributing constraints. Also, I have seen how scaling is applied from using optimization to determine the minimal value(s) in functions to appling optimization in real life scenerios.\n",

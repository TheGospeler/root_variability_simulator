    "ODEs are interesting phenomenon that has been used to simulate several rates of changes in systems, such as the root zone, soil dynamics, and other specialized environment. Related to the area of my research, ODEs have been used in several studies including simulating water and nutrients uptake by the roots in the soil (Blengino Albrieu et al., 2015; Roose & Fowler, 2004) and simulating root growth and spatial variability (Dupuy et al., 2010). \n",

    "Athough, studies on root system growth began far back in the 1970s, a more active studies began recently in simulating and predicting root growth achitecture within soils. Dupuy et al., (2010), used the \"root density distributions as a function of individual root developmental parameters such as rates of lateral root initiation, elongation, mortality, and gravitropsm\".\n",

    "They were able to simultate the growth of roots efficiently in a discretized domains that deform as a result of growth, which is a characteristic of the ODE approach, and utilizes this model to simultate the growth of many interacting root system.\n",

    "I aim to study the denstity formular Dupuy et al. used, and further utilize this approach in visualizing and simulating the root spatial variability as a secondary approach in my research study areas."
